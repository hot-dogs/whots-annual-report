# Woods Hole - Hawaii Ocean Time-series Site
## The WHOTS Project

In 2003, Robert Weller (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [WHOI]), 
Albert Plueddemann (WHOI) and Roger Lukas (University of Hawaii [UH]) 
proposed to establish a long-term surface mooring at the Hawaii Ocean 
Time-series (HOT) Station ALOHA (22Â° 45'N, 158Â° W) to provide sustained, 
high-quality air-sea fluxes and the associated upper ocean response 
as a coordinated part of the HOT program, and as an element in the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) array of global ocean 
reference stations


With support from the NOAA and the National Science Foundation (NSF), 
the WHOI HOT Site (WHOTS) surface mooring has been maintained at Station 
ALOHA since August 2004. The objective of this project is to provide 
long-term, high-quality air-sea fluxes as a coordinated part of the 
HOT program and contribute to the goals of observing heat, fresh water 
and chemical fluxes at a site representative of the oligotrophic North 
Pacific Ocean. The approach is to maintain a surface mooring outfitted 
for meteorological and oceanographic measurements at a site near Station 
ALOHA by successive mooring turnarounds. These observations will be 
used to investigate air sea interaction processes related to climate 
variability.
