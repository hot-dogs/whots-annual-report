# Woods Hole - Hawaii Ocean Time-series Site
## The WHOTS Project

In 2003, Robert Weller (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution [WHOI]), 
Albert Plueddemann (WHOI) and Roger Lukas (University of Hawaii [UH]) 
proposed to establish a long-term surface mooring at the Hawaii Ocean 
Time-series (HOT) Station ALOHA (22° 45'N, 158° W) to provide sustained, 
high-quality air-sea fluxes and the associated upper ocean response 
as a coordinated part of the HOT program, and as an element in the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) array of global ocean 
reference stations
